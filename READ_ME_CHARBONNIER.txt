This project involved scraping data from Google DeepMind's blog, building a JSON database, and creating an API to query the data.

The first step was to extract article information from the DeepMind website using Selenium. The Python script accessed the site and looped through each article. 
It parsed relevant details like the title, description, date and URL from the HTML.

These scrapings were stored in a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing one article's data. 
The list of article dicts was then serialized to a JSON file, creating the database.

Storing the data in a portable JSON format allows it to be loaded and queried independently of the scraping. The file acts as a local database for the article information.

With the database established, the next phase was developing a REST API with Flask to interface with the data.
Routes were defined to perform given tasks keeping in mind that the goal is to make the tools available so that people interested in AI can get information. The API is therefore focused on practicality.

Here are the roots : 

- Get the number of articles in the database (this is more a test root with no real utility for the user other than checking the length of the database)
- Get the url of the articles : we can imagine that the user wants to have a full view over the articles and check them independently
    FOr the url, we created a specific root, if we enter a specific URL, we can access to all the infos about this url (Publication date, title, description..)
- Get the catagories of the articles : one can look at the distribution of the articles categoires (Research articles, articles about a company ...)
    For the categories, we also created a specific root. If we choose a certain category (for example RESEARCH), we can access to all the informations of the certain category.
- Get the titles of the articles : we can look at the different titles and see which articles seem interesting.
- Get all the informations on the articles (NÂ°, publication date, title..)
    We can also select a specific number of article to access to all the informations on this article.
To test the API, the Flask development server was run. Requests were sent using a web browser to call the different endpoints and get dynamic responses with the queried data.
